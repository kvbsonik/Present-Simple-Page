		<h2>WHAT IS PAST SIMPLE?</h2>
		<p class="tekst">
			The <span style="color:#0DD632; font-weight:bold;">past simple</span> tense shows that you are talking about something that has already happened. Unlike the past continuous tense, which is used to talk about past events that happened over a period of time, the simple past tense emphasizes that the action is finished.
